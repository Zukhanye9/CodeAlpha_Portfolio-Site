    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Zukhanye Kamlana. I am a final-year student at the University of Fort Hare,
        where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Commerce in Information Systems. Born and raised in the
        vibrant township of Mdantsane in East London, South Africa, I have developed a strong foundation
        in both academic and practical aspects of information systems.

    <p>
        Throughout my academic journey, I have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in various areas of
        technology and business. I have gained substantial knowledge in Microsoft Excel, databases,
        cascading style sheets (CSS), object-oriented programming, .NET Framework, Bootstrap, C#, the
        Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), ASP.NET, Microsoft SQL Server, and graphical user
        interface (GUI) design. My analytical skills have been honed through rigorous coursework and
        hands-on projects, making me adept at problem-solving and critical thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to my academic pursuits, I have also accumulated valuable work experience. I am
        currently interning at CodSoft, where I am involved in a virtual Java internship program. This
        opportunity has enabled me to apply my theoretical knowledge in a practical setting, further
        enhancing my technical skills and understanding of real-world applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        Moreover, I have worked as an examination assistant, a role that has equipped me with the ability
        to work under pressure, excellent numeracy skills, time management, attention to detail, teamwork,
        and problem-solving abilities.
